      ðŸš€ Smart Push CLI installed successfully!
      
      Usage:
        smart-push [commit-message] [branch-name]
      
      Examples:
        smart-push "Fix user login bug"
        smart-push "Add new feature" feature-branch
      
      The script will automatically:
      - Detect project type (frontend/backend)
      - Suggest smart commit messages
      - Run pre-commit checks
      - Handle git add/commit/pull/push workflow
      
      Make sure you're in a git repository when running the command.
